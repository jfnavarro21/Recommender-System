Collaborative Filtering Recommender for Music

This system is from the Advanced Machine Learning Course in the Master's of Data Analytics program at the University of Chicago

The project is to develop a latent factor model to predict ratings for user/artist pairs on the Audioscrobbler(last.fm) data set. I utilized Alternating Least Squares method to estimate the latent factors

The code is written in Pyspark and was run on the University of Chicago Spark cluster

Achieved a mean AUC of 85% for predictions on the holdout set
